##Investigate a dataset

This project was done to complete a data analysis nanodegree on Udacity
I picked three datasets from the Gapminder website.

Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years,and on a number of different indicators. In the coal_consumption_total.csv dataset, (source: The coal consumption, total
dataset in energy/coal/ folder on https://www.gapminder.org/data/) the columns are the countries and value of coal
consumption each year from 1965 to 2019

In the oil_consumption_total.csv dataset,(source: The oil consumption, total dataset in energy/oil/ folder
onhttps://www.gapminder.org/data/) the columns are the countries and value of oilconsumption each year from 1965 to 2019

and in the consumption_co2_emissions_1000_tonnes.csv, (source: The consumption_co2_emissions_1000_tonnes dataset
in environments/emissions/ folder on https://www.gapminder.org/data/) the columns are the countries and value of co2 emissions each year from 1990 to 2017

Question(s) for Analysis
what is the general trend in the consumption of coal between 2007 and 2017
what is the general trend in the consumption of oil between 2007 and 2017
what is the general trend in the emission of co2 between 2007 and 2017
What top 10 countries have the highest coal consumption, oil consumption and emission of co2
What top 10 countries have the lowest coal consumption, oil consumption and emission of co2
