## Investigate a dataset

This project was done to complete a data analysis nanodegree on Udacity
I picked three datasets from the Gapminder website.

Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years,and on a number of different indicators. 
The datasets used in the analysis are -
- [coal_consumption_total.csv dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
The dataset is found in energy/coal/ folder the columns are the countries and value of coal
consumption each year from 1965 to 2019

- [oil_consumption_total.csv dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
The dataset is found in energy/oil/ folder on the columns are the countries and value of oil
consumption each year from 1965 to 2019


- [consumption_co2_emissions_1000_tonnes.csv dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
The dataset is found in energy/emissions/ folder on the columns are the countries and value of co2 emission 
consumption each year from 1965 to 2019

#### Question(s) for Analysis
- what is the general trend in the consumption of coal between 2007 and 2017
- what is the general trend in the consumption of oil between 2007 and 2017
- what is the general trend in the emission of co2 between 2007 and 2017
- which top 10 countries have the highest coal consumption, oil consumption and emission of co2
- which top 10 countries have the lowest coal consumption, oil consumption and emission of co2
